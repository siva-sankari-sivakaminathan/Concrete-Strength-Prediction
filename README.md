**Objective**

To predict the concrete strength using the data available in file "concrete.csv". Apply feature engineering and model tuning to obtain a score above 85%.

**Steps and Tasks:**

**Exploratory Data Quality Report Reflecting the Following:**

Univariate analysis â€“data types and description of the independent attributes which should include (name, range of values observed, central values (mean and median), standard deviation and quartiles, analysis of the body of distributions/tails, missing values, outliers, duplicates
Bi-variate analysis between the predictor variables and between the predictor variables and target column. Comment on your findings in terms of their relationship and degree of relation if any. Visualize the analysis using boxplots and pair plots, histograms, or density curves. 
Feature Engineering techniques
Identify opportunities to extract new features from existing features, drop a feature(if required) Hint: Feature Extraction, for example, consider a dataset with two features length and breadth. From this, we can extract a new feature Area which would be length * breadth.
Get the data model ready and do a train test split.
Decide on the complexity of the model, should it be a simple linear model in terms of parameters or would a quadratic or higher degree.
 

**Creating the Model and Tuning It:**

Algorithms suitable for this project. Kfold Cross-Validation to evaluate model performance. Appropriate metrics and make a DataFrame to compare models w.r.t their metrics.  
Techniques employed to squeeze that extra performance out of the model without making it overfit. Use Grid Search or Random Search on any of the two models used above. Make a DataFrame to compare models after hyperparameter tuning and their metrics as above.
